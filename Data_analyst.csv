A globally distributed team of 200+ experts united by a shared purpose: the continuous pursuit of quality.Our clients come to us for results, quality and craft - and stay because we keep raising the bar.We do things differently at LateralOur mission is simple: design and build great products.What sets us apart isn’t just the talent of our team - it’s the way we work:We Have A Bias For Action & Results.We are doers - we spot the gaps, connect the dots, anticipate what’s around the corner and take action. We move fast, stay focused, and let the results - not the effort - speak for themselves.We Work On Time, On Budget, On QualityDiscipline is our edge - a commitment we make to each other, to our clients, and to the standards we hold ourselves toWe Care Deeply.We care about our work and about each other. Care Is A Competitive Advantage.Every detail matters. Every design, every line of code, every decision. Thoughtful by default.We Do Things Right - Because It’s the Right Thing to DoRight over easy. Integrity isn’t up for negotiation. We hold the bar high even when no one’s watching. We take pride in doing great work the right way - not the easy way.We Keep ImprovingThe best teams keep improving and we’re never done learning.We iterate. We reflect on what’s working and what’s not. Feedback fuels us, we receive it openly, and adapt quickly. Progress over perfection.We’re Obsessed With Agility, Not The Agile ManifestoWe don’t chase dogma or rituals - we chase momentum. We adapt processes to fit problems, not the other way around.We Take OwnershipEveryone leads something here. You will have room to run with ideas, and the trust to execute. That trust is built on how you show up: thinking things through, sweating the details, and following through.What You’ll DoAs a Power BI/Data Analyst at Lateral, you will:Design and Build Dashboards: Create and maintain insightful, visually compelling dashboards and reports in Power BI. You’ll gather requirements from stakeholders and translate business needs into interactive reports that drive decision-making. Expect to iterate on designs and refine visuals to tell clear data stories.Perform Data Modeling & Analytics: Develop robust data models and analytical workflows to support reporting and deeper analysis. This includes shaping and transforming data (using Power Query, SQL, or Python) to ensure reliable, analyzable datasets. You’ll define relationships, calculations, and measures (DAX) that yield accurate insights.Partner with Stakeholders: Work directly with clients and team members to understand key business questions and KPIs. Throughout the full project lifecycle, you’ll translate business needs into data solutions. You will explain your analyses and dashboards clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring insights are understood and actionable.Ensure Data Quality and Integrity: Take ownership of data accuracy end-to-end. You’ll validate and test data, troubleshoot discrepancies, and implement checks so that every report is trusted. Maintain documentation of data definitions and assumptions. At every step, uphold best practices for data governance and security.Optimize and Iterate: Continuously improve the performance and usability of our analytics solutions. You’ll optimize SQL queries and Power BI data models for efficiency, ensuring quick load times and up-to-date data. Incorporate feedback from users to enhance functionality and refine metrics as needs evolve.Contribute to Data Strategy: Look beyond immediate requests to identify new opportunities where data can add value. You might research emerging BI features, propose new analytics methodologies, or develop internal tools to push our data capabilities forward. We expect you to think strategically about how to leverage data for maximum impact.Improve Yourself and the Team: During times you’re not assigned to a client project, you won’t be idle. You might build internal analytics tools, research new technologies or techniques (e.g., a new Azure analytics service or Python library), or help with recruiting and mentoring. You’ll help push our data craft and capabilities forward.Mentor and Share Knowledge: Lead by example in fostering a data-driven culture. You will support junior analysts (formally or informally), offer constructive feedback on their work, and share best practices in data analysis, visualization design, and data storytelling. You’ll help cultivate a thoughtful, kind, and continuously learning team culture.How We Measure Success In This RoleIn the first two weeksYou’ve set up all necessary access to databases, Power BI, and Azure resources, and made your first meaningful contribution (for example, fixing a report, creating a simple analysis, or improving an existing dashboard).You communicate well both asynchronously (in writing) and in meetings, asking clarifying questions and sharing updates proactively.In the first 3 months:You understand our data sources, models, and business domain well, and can work independently (or in small teams) on medium-sized analytics projects.You plan before you build: outlining data requirements or sketching a report design before diving into development (and producing any needed design artifacts or documentation).You have delivered at least one significant dashboard or analysis to production use, with clean implementation and validated results.You communicate clearly, raising issues or data concerns early and contributing thoughtfully to code reviews or design discussions.You consistently deliver on your commitments, meeting deadlines and ensuring your work meets our quality standards.After 3 months:You take ownership of larger analytical initiatives and improvements from start to finish (for example, leading the development of a new data model or a suite of reports for a major client.)You help others by sharing knowledge, spotting data issues or process gaps early, and proposing improvements to our tools or workflows (perhaps optimizing an ETL process or improving how we organize reports).You make decisions with both data integrity and business goals in mind, balancing technical correctness with actionable insight for the client.We measure success through:Impact of your work: Evaluating results of what you’ve delivered (are your dashboards and insights driving decisions or improvements?)Quality and reliability of your analyses: The accuracy, consistency, and performance of your data models and reports.Consistency in delivery: Your track record of meeting commitments and delivering value on time.Feedback from peers and leads: Input on your collaboration, communication, and the value you add to projects.Your ability to work independently and unblock others: How well you can move projects forward on your own, and how you help teammates overcome data challenges or confusion.What We’re Looking ForWe are seeking team members who have strong technical skills and who deeply care about their craft and how the work gets done. You must bring:5+ years of experience in data analysis, business intelligence, or a related field, with a track record of delivering analytics solutions (dashboards, reports, and data models) from concept to insight.Proficiency in Power BI: hands-on experience building interactive dashboards and reports. You can create effective data visualizations and have strong DAX skills for custom measures and calculations.Advanced SQL skills: able to write and optimize complex queries to manipulate and retrieve data from relational databases.
