"Over 200 applicants","EXTERNAL","","Atticus","https://www.linkedin.com/company/atticushq","Full-time","About AtticusAt any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.The JobOur business generates a wealth of data with untapped potential to support people in need of aid, and improve their likelihood of positive outcomes in the legal system. Our platform covers a lot: evaluating a client’s case, giving advice, matching them with the right lawyer, formalizing the arrangement, and helping both parties work together as the case progresses. The data we generate across this end-to-end journey provides a unique opportunity to improve client experiences at a national scale for the legal practice areas we support, using novel data unavailable to other industry actors (individual law firms, government agencies).We are looking for Data Scientists to join our team and leverage this data to fulfill our mission. You’ll help establish the central Data Science team with our Lead Data Scientist, and embed closely with departments within Atticus to help us better apply data across all areas of our platform.Serve as a founding member of the company’s data science function, building a culture of collaboration, growth, and excellence that will attract talent for years to comeDesign metrics, build data pipelines, run experiments, launch models – apply a broad toolkit to expansive data from a rapidly growing businessWork closely with department leads and their teams to ensure our decision-making and operations are data-informedInterpret data as the collective voice of our clients, generating insights that inform our product roadmap and user experience Hold teams accountable to measurable impact, enabling them to identify and target their most effective levers to improve the businessThe role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.<br><br>Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we&#x2019;ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits.

At Tocaro Blue, your expertise in designing, training, and deploying custom ML models will directly advance our foundational perception stack, ProteusCore.As a Senior ML Researcher, you will be the lead architect of Radar (and secondary EO/IR) models for object detection, semantic segmentation, and tracking. You’ll design algorithms capable of distinguishing vessels, land, shoreline constructions, wakes, and markers in dynamic maritime environments where off-the-shelf models fall short.Your Work Will Fuel Products Used By Defense customers developing USVs/ASVs for the U.S. Navy. Commercial OEMs bringing advanced marine ADAS and autopilot features to market.This role is an opportunity to define the ML foundations of maritime autonomy—where perception evolves from situational awareness, to navigation assistance, to full autonomy.What You’ll PioneerCore ML and Autonomy Innovation Invent and refine custom deep learning architectures for Radar and EO/IR imagery, with an emphasis on semantic segmentation and temporal tracking, not just detection. Develop multi-stage ML pipelines (context + characteristic models, segmentation + classification) tailored to low-SNR Radar returns. Train models on proprietary large-scale datasets (millions of Radar samples and camera sequences) with design-of-experiment methods for data collection and annotation. Optimize and deploy models to resource-constrained edge hardware (CPU-only and ARM64 platforms), including C++ inference layers. Advance fusion-aware ML models that integrate Radar with EO/IR, AIS, and cartography for robust classification in GPS-denied or cluttered environments. Collaborate with fusion and autonomy engineers to ensure ML outputs integrate seamlessly into multi-target tracking and SLAM pipelines. Contribute to ML-Ops workflows: data management, large-scale training, continuous integration of new field data, and automated evaluation pipelines.What Sets You ApartEssential Qualifications Advanced degree (MS/PhD) in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics, or related field. 7+ years applying machine learning and signal processing to real-world dynamic systems (graduate research counts if directly applicable). Demonstrated mastery of semantic segmentation and object classification models, ideally applied to non-vision sensor modalities. Expert-level Python skills with ML frameworks (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, or equivalent).Preferred Expertise Track record of developing ML models beyond standard YOLO-style detectors, particularly for segmentation of noisy or sparse data (Radar, sonar, or medical imaging). Strong background in computer vision and temporal modeling (CNNs, transformers, RNNs for sequential sensor data). Experience deploying ML to embedded/edge platforms with optimized C++ inference. Knowledge of marine, automotive, or aerial robotics systems. Contributions to large-scale ML data pipelines: annotation strategies, dataset balancing, simulation-to-real transfer. Passion for pushing the boundaries of AI in GPS-denied, cluttered, and low-visibility environments.Why Tocaro Blue?Competitive Compensation & Growth $132,000–$160,000 base salary with potential equity in a rapidly growing company. Comprehensive benefits: 401(k) with 4% company matching, full health/dental/vision, life & disability insurance, generous PTO.
